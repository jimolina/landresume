A WordPress Theme to use as LandPage Resume.

After I created my own personal Resume Online: [www.josemolinaresume.com](http://www.josemolinaresume.com) using #Html, #JQuery, #Bootrstrap4 and #FontAwesome, I decide create a WP custom theme with the same design and share with everybody that need it.

**Landresume** is a clean & responsive Landing Page theme that is easy to use by users of all levels. **Landresume** allows you to use your content into creating a powerful site for your personal #Resume. Additionally it is very convinient for a Developer profile.

## Installation

1. In order to use this WP Theme, you will need have instaled at least WP 4.7.5
2. This WP Theme use a simple plugin that I created too: "jm-social-media-font-awesome". So, please install this plugin **FIRST**
3. Clone or download this repository and put the folder "landresume" inside your "wp-content/themes" folder.
4. Use the file "initial-data.xml" to load the initial data. After this step, will be super easy modify all the photos and content.

## Layout

**Landresume** uses a subset of [Bootstrap 4 Alpha](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) CSS
framework by default.

## TODO

1. Activate the Post Type on the Plugin jm-social-media-font-awesome.
2. Add the code in the General Content Template to show the FA Icons type ASIDE.
3. Add a slider component in the Portfolio Detail page, in order to show more than 1 image as example for each project.
4. Add a way to assign dynamically the Icons for each Post Category.
